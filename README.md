# Complex, Re-Usable, Performance-Optimised VBA Functions (2017 - 2019)
At GenSight, we provide software solutions to portfolio management for a range of clients including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, GSK and many more. As well as providing a highly configurable web application, we provide, two-way integration with Microsoft Excel, which has been proven to be very popular among finance professionals.

These functions were developed during my time at GenSight, where I worked on the Project Financial Tool for Johnson & Johnson.
These functions have been used in other Dynamic Documents such as Sales Entry, Capex and Investment Entry for the clients, Baxter and GSK, which saved development time.
