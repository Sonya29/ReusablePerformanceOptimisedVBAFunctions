# Complex, Re-Usable, Performance-Optimised VBA Functions (2017 - 2019)
At GenSight, we provide software solutions to portfolio management for a range of clients including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, GSK and many more. As well as providing a highly configurable web application, we provide, two-way integration with Microsoft Excel, which has been proven to be very popular among finance professionals.

These functions were developed during my time at GenSight, where I worked on the Project Financial Tool for Johnson & Johnson.
These functions have been used in other Dynamic Documents such as Sales Entry, Capex and Investment Entry for the clients, Baxter and GSK, which saved development time.

My second job since grduation was at a non-profit organisation, Marie Curie, where I got involved in many projects (mainly web apps). However, the fundraising team requested that they'd like to update fundraiser's information via a spreadsheet, and that any changes to this document, should indeed be reflected on their web pages. This involved writing some VBA and pointing out problems to this approach, including security, difficulty in maintainance as well as the lack of knowledge in the VBA progrramming language within the team.
